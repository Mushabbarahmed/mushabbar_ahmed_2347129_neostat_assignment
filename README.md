## Introduction

Neostat is an end-to-end data analytics and pipeline automation project that processes raw sales data using Azure services and provides actionable insights through Power BI. This project ensures scalability, security, and efficiency while delivering interactive dashboards for decision-making.

---

## Solution Architecture

The project integrates the following components:
- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**: Scalable and secure storage for raw and processed data.
- **Azure Data Factory**: Automates data ingestion, cleaning, and transformation pipelines.
- **Power BI**: Creates dynamic and interactive dashboards for visualization and analysis.

## Pipeline Components

1. **Data Ingestion Pipeline**:
   - Uploads raw sales data (CSV format) into Azure Data Lake Storage.
   - Performs schema validation and detects missing values.

2. **Data Cleaning Pipeline**:
   - Handles missing values, ensures schema compliance, and masks sensitive data.

3. **Data Transformation Pipeline**:
   - Adds calculated fields like `TotalSales` and `ProfitMargin`.
   - Segments customers and aggregates sales data by location.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Uses Power BI to analyze trends, customer segmentation, and product performance.
